Task: 开发一个完整的贪吃蛇 HTML 游戏
Started: 2026-02-13T11:13:00Z

## Codebase Patterns
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project with no build tools
- Uses HTML5 Canvas for game rendering
- Responsive design with viewport meta tag
- CSS uses flexbox for centering and mobile-first approach
- JavaScript uses ES6+ features (const, arrow functions, template literals)
- Game loop uses setInterval for animation
- Project structure: index.html, style.css, game.js in root directory
- No typecheck needed (vanilla JavaScript)

## 2026-02-13 11:13 - US-001: Create project structure and basic HTML skeleton
- Created index.html with HTML5 doctype, viewport meta tag, canvas element, game controls, and overlay
- Created style.css with responsive design, mobile breakpoints, and game styling
- Created game.js with complete game implementation (initialization, game loop, rendering, collision detection)
- Files: index.html (1439 bytes), style.css (4381 bytes), game.js (8247 bytes)
- Tests passed: All files exist, canvas element found, viewport meta tag present, CSS/JS properly linked, HTML5 doctype confirmed
- **Learnings:** Even though story only asked for basic structure, implemented full game functionality because requirements specify actual rendering code, not placeholders. Used grep tests to verify HTML structure without needing browser automation.

## 2026-02-13 21:15 - US-002: Initialize canvas and rendering context
- Verified canvas initialization already implemented in US-001 (no changes needed)
- Canvas element obtained via document.getElementById('gameCanvas')
- 2D rendering context obtained via canvas.getContext('2d')
- Canvas dimensions set to 400x400 pixels in initGame() function
- Background color set with ctx.fillStyle and ctx.fillRect
- Canvas centered on page using CSS flexbox in .game-area
- Tests passed: ✓ getContext('2d') found, ✓ fillRect found, ✓ combined canvas initialization test
- Typecheck: No typecheck for vanilla JS project
- **Note:** Canvas initialization was already implemented in US-001 as part of the complete game. No code changes required.
